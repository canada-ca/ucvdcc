# Providing Feedback

**Review the documentation.** No account is needed to review the documents here. However, if you wish to comment you must:

1. **Establish a GitHub account.** In order to submit a comment through the GitHub “Issues” feature, you will need to create a GitHub account. This can be done by proceeding to [https://github.com/join](https://github.com/join). **For issues submitted on behalf of an organization, a generic account named for the organization is preferred, rather than a personal account from someone within the organization.**

2. **Open an issue.** As you are reading and identify comments you would like to make:
   1. Click on the "Issues" tab on the navigation bar.

If you are familiar with GitHub you are also welcome to provide suggestions to concrete changes as a pull request (PR). We prefer PRs as follows:

1. Fork a copy of canada-ca/ucvdcc to your own organization/personal space.
2. Create a branch in your fork, named specifically for the edit you propose. PRs should be focused, rather than broad-sweeping updates.
3. Issue a PR from your branch to the `master` branch in canada-ca/ucvdcc.
4. If we intend to merge the PR, we may engage via PR reviews and request changes before completing the merge.

Please provide information about your organization and rationale for the suggested change.
