**CALL FOR PROPOSAL NO: EN578-170003/B**

## CHALLENGE BEING ADDRESSED: *User-Centric Verifiable Digital Credentials*

### 1. Title

### 2. Introduction

The Innovative Solutions Canada Program (ISC) is designed to support the development of early-stage, pre-commercial innovations by small businesses that have no more than 499 employees and demonstrate the capacity to develop an innovative solution to a federal department or agency challenge.

### 3. Program Background

The ISC program is a multi-stage program that seeks solutions to challenges that start at the earliest level of technology development. Phase 1 targets proposed solutions starting at technology readiness levels (TRLs) 1-4 (inclusive), while Phase 2 is meant to further advance the TRL of the innovation.

* **Phase 1: Proof of Concept**<br>
  Phase 1 is for the development and delivery of a proof of concept addressing a challenge articulated by a federal department or agency. The proof of concept will have to demonstrate the scientific and technical feasibility, and commercial potential, of a novel solution that addresses a federal department’s challenge.
* **Phase 2: Prototype Development**<br>
  Small businesses that successfully complete Phase 1 may receive a contract to develop their solution beyond the proof of concept with the goal of developing and delivering a prototype addressing a federal department’s challenge.

### 4. Phase Addressed under this Statement of Work

**Phase 1 Proof of Concept**<br>
This challenge is seeking a portable secure digital credentials (self-sovereign identity) solution held by individuals that can be independently, cryptographically and rapidly verified using emerging distributed ledger standards and an approach that may give rise to a global digital verification platform. For many contexts, ranging from applying for a job to transiting checkpoints for aviation security, paper documents remain the predominant way to prove key attributes about an individual, such as their name, date of birth, academic/professional qualifications, or security clearance. While these attributes might be presented in digital form, there are no widely adopted or standardized methods to issue and rapidly verify digital credentials across many different contexts. There exists no current capability to digitally verify without dependencies on centralized or low-latency network platforms (or both).

### 5. Objective

The objective of this contract is to develop and deliver a Proof of Concept addressing the Challenge.

This Proof of Concept will demonstrate value for the following [use cases](use-cases.md)
